  "whatIsEbecText": "EASTERN BEST ENGINEERING COMPETITION is a team based competition that consists of 3 steps, which are divided into two parts as inovative design and case analysis. Both categories are depended on interdisciplinary tasks to enable technology students to use the theoretical informations that they’ve found. The activities are lined up as a pyramid shape starting with the local step and after the country-based step the competition ends with the Europe finale . EBEC is organised once a year and the process continues from local step til the final step.",
